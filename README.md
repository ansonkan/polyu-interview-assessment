# About
This is a coding assessment of a interview. My task is to clone the first page of https://i-mos.org/imos/ . Since there are not requirments in library chose, I picked Gatsby.js. This project is built opon the <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world" target="_blank">gatsby-starter-hello-world</a> starter.

## Quick start
Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

```shell
cd polyu-interview-assessment/
gatsby develop
```

Then the site will be running `http://localhost:8000`!
